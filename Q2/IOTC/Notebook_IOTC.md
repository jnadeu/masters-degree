- **NFC (Near Field Communication):** A set of short-range wireless technologies typically requiring a distance of 4 cm or less to initiate a connection, used for sharing small data payloads between devices or tags.
- **Outcome-based model:** An IoT business model where customers pay for the achieved outcome of using an IoT product or service, rather than the device itself (e.g., printers reordering ink).
- **Pay-per-usage model:** An IoT business model that charges customers based on their actual consumption or usage of a product or service.
- **Personal Data:** Information that can directly or indirectly identify an individual (e.g., name, email, geolocation data), subject to strict regulations in IoT to ensure privacy.
- **Predictive Maintenance:** The use of data and analysis to predict when equipment failure might occur, allowing maintenance to be scheduled proactively, minimizing downtime and costs.
- **Privacy Issues:** Concerns in IoT related to the vast amounts of personal data collected, necessitating regulations like GDPR to ensure responsible and secure handling.
- **Publisher-Subscriber Model:** A messaging pattern used by protocols like MQTT and DDS where "publishers" send messages on specific "topics" without knowing the "subscribers," and "subscribers" receive messages on topics they are interested in.
- **RGPD (Reglamento General de Protección de Datos/General Data Protection Regulation):** A European Union regulation for data protection and privacy, setting principles like responsibility, data protection by design, and transparency for handling personal data in IoT.
- **Resilience:** The ability of IoT systems to recover quickly from disruptions, involving real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, and rerouting of data/operations.
- **Resistive Sensors:** A type of sensor where the measured physical magnitude causes a change in electrical resistance, which is then measured. They require an external excitation.
- **RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification):** A technology that uses radio waves to wirelessly read information contained in a "tag" from a distance, commonly used for inventory and asset tracking.
- **Scalability:** The ability of an IoT system to support a growing number of devices and handle increasing volumes of data without compromising performance or reliability.
- **SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition):** A control system architecture that uses computers, networked data communications, and graphical user interfaces for high-level process supervisory management. Often used with Modbus.
- **Sensor:** A device that measures a physical phenomenon and transforms it into an electrical signal, typically a type of transducer.
- **SigFox:** A long-range, low-power wireless technology (LPWAN) designed for small, infrequent data transmissions, operating in the sub-GHz band, with a proprietary network infrastructure.
- **Smart Home:** An example of IoT application in daily life, where multiple sensors and actuators control home functions like lighting, climate, and security.
- **Ubiquitous Computing:** A concept (Mark Weiser) where computation is seamlessly integrated into the environment, and devices interact naturally without explicit user awareness, enhancing the natural integration of IoT.
- **Wi-Fi:** A wireless networking technology that uses radio frequencies to transmit data, enabling access to networks and connectivity between devices over a medium range.
- **XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol):** An open-source, decentralized, and standardized XML streaming protocol for real-time messaging, often used for device-to-device communication with high security and flexibility.
- **Z-Wave:** A proprietary wireless communication protocol primarily used for smart home devices, operating on a specific low frequency (908.42 MHz) and supporting mesh networking.
- **Zigbee:** A low-power, low-cost wireless technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, designed for mesh networking and ideal for battery-operated devices in smart home and industrial applications.
