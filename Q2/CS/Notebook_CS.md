**1. Markov Decision Process (MDP)**

A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a mathematical framework used to model decision-making in situations where outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision-maker. In the context of Reinforcement Learning (RL), the MDP is used to model the link between the environment and the agent. It is described as a multi-stage decision-making process, often Markovian. Both value iteration and policy iteration are standard algorithms for solving MDPs.

- **Visual Schema/Diagram:** The sources mention that the MDP is used to model the interaction between the agent and the environment in RL. Source references "Fig. 7. Illustration of the DRL-based MR navigation," which depicts the interaction between the DRL-based navigation system's agent and environment. However, the sources do not contain a general visual schema or diagram specifically illustrating the components and transitions within a standard Markov Decision Process (states, actions, state transitions with probabilities, and rewards).

**2. Reinforcement Learning (RL) and its applications to mobile robotics path planning**

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Unlike other forms of learning, it is a multi-stage decision-making process, often Markovian. An RL agent must learn by trial-and-error, which is not entirely supervised but interactive. Actions taken by the agent may affect not only the immediate reward but also subsequent rewards, showing a delayed effect. The goal of RL is to optimize a long-term collective value of rewards rather than just immediate rewards.

RL is applied in robotics science and can be used to enhance the efficiency of mobile robots' reactive navigation. It allows mobile robots to recognize paths based on prior behavior. The Markov decision process (MDP) is used to model the link between the environment and the agent in RL. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), a form of RL, can be developed for mobile robot navigation. DRL-based navigation systems involve an agent interacting with its environment, where the DRL agent replaces components of the conventional navigation system like localization, map-generating, and local path planning sections. Applications of RL algorithms for navigation purposes have been described. For example, Inverse RL has been used to simulate human behavior in navigation coordination, and a fuzzy controller with supervised learning assisted RL can be used for obstacle avoidance.

- **Visual Schema/Diagram:** Source mentions "Fig. 7. Illustration of the DRL-based MR navigation," which shows the interaction between the DRL-based navigation system's agent and environment. The agent receives the environment state, takes an action, and receives a reward from the environment. Based on the text, the environment provides states and rewards in response to the agent's actions. The agent perceives the environment, takes actions, and learns from the resulting rewards.
- **Key elements of RL:**
    - **Agent:** The entity in an RL system that perceives the environment, takes actions, and learns from the resulting rewards. In the context of mobile robots, the mobile robot itself acts as the agent.
    - **Environment:** The external system with which the RL agent interacts, providing states and rewards in response to the agent's actions. In the context of mobile robots, everything around the agent is known as the environment.
    - **Reward (Reward Function):** A scalar feedback signal from the environment that indicates the desirability of the agent's state or action. It maps each state (or state-action pair) to a real number, called reward. The agent receives this feedback signal as a reward quantity for training.

**3. PID Controller**

A PID controller is a widely used **closed-loop algorithm** in academic and industrial research due to its simplicity and higher performance. It is considered a highly precise and reliable controller that uses a feedback system known as the control loop for controlling variables that impact a process. The primary goal of a PID controller is to **minimize the error signal** between calculated and expected operational variable values. The error signal is defined as the discrepancy between a calculated value of an operational variable and the expected value in a feedback-controlled system.

The control action ùë¢(ùë°) of a PID controller is defined by the equation: ùë¢(ùë°) = ùëòùëù‚Öá(ùë°) + ùëò ‚à´ ‚Öá(ùë°) ‚ÖÜ 0 + ùëò ùëë‚Öá(ùë°) ùëë, where ùëòùëù, ùëòùëñ, and ùëòùëë are the proportional, integral, and derivative parameters, and ‚Öá(ùë°) is the error signal. The proportional, integral, and derivative components work together to provide a control plan.

- **Application Example in Robotics:** PID controllers are the most used control algorithm implemented in robotic systems and are almost exclusively necessary for high-end robots with powerful dynamics and excellent mobility precision. They can be used to solve path-finding issues for mobile robots by integrating the mobile robot model with a delay and an integrator. This simple integration process allows the PID controller to be adjusted while using nominal effectiveness and reliability as control parameters. Another application is path tracking for mobile robots using a robust PID controller. A fuzzy-PID controller has also been designed for path tracking of mobile robots with a differential drive, which provides a greater rate of convergence than the traditional PID controller for a mobile robot with any variable starting state.
- **Visual Schema/Diagram:** Source mentions "Fig. 2. PID controller for controlling a MR to a distance," illustrating how a PID controller might be set up to guide a mobile robot towards a target distance by processing the error signal. The sources do not contain a general block diagram of a PID controller showing the proportional, integral, and derivative components processing the error signal to produce a control output.

**4. Model Predictive Controllers (MPC)**

Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a modern control technique that **implements a dynamical system to predict the evolution of state trajectories** and optimize the control signal within acceptable input ranges. MPC has the potential to generate optimal responses while taking the system's state and input constraints into consideration. It develops the control rule implicitly by solving a constrained optimization problem.

A key component of MPC is the **receding horizon optimization control formulation**. This formulation determines the best control series over a limited prediction horizon. At each time step *t*, the optimal control sequence is determined over a limited future horizon of *N* steps.

MPC techniques are used for mobile robot navigation and model-predictive motion planning for autonomous mobile robots. Examples include interactive MPC for robot navigation in dense crowds, perception-aware MPC for quadrotors, robust constrained learning-based NMPC enabling reliable mobile robot path tracking, collision-free navigation using convex quadratic programming-based MPC, and nonlinear MPC for omnidirectional robot motion planning and tracking with avoidance of moving obstacles.

**5. Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)**

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) addresses the "Chicken-and-egg problem" where **localization assumes a map is available, but mapping assumes localization is solved**. The core problem of SLAM is to concurrently build a map of an unknown environment while keeping track of the robot's own location within that map. The goal is to **jointly estimate the map and the robot pose within the map**.

In SLAM, the state that is being estimated comprises both the robot's poses (position and orientation) and the representation of the map. Different map representations can be used, including:

- **Feature-based map:** Contains metric information with distinguishable landmarks but no information about obstacles.
- **Occupancy grid map:** Provides metric information, traversability, and obstacle information. It is represented by a grid estimating the probability of a location being occupied.
- **Topological/semantic map:** Lacks metric information but includes semantic labels. Other representations include point clouds and other 3D maps.

The Bayes' Filter provides a general solution framework for state estimation in SLAM, recursively updating belief based on motion and measurements. Approaches for solving the SLAM problem include:

- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF-SLAM):** Applies the Kalman filter recursion to a linearized model but suffers from limitations in scalability and robustness to nonlinearity and outliers.
- **Particle Filter (PF-SLAM):** Uses a set of weighted particles to approximate the trajectory posterior and performs mapping for each particle. It allows for more relaxed assumptions than EKF but can face particle depletion in high-dimensional spaces. FAST-SLAM is a specific implementation. Source mentions gmapping as a ROS package for PF-SLAM, which requires a 2D laser scanner and decent odometry.
- **Maximum a posteriori (MAP) Estimation:** An alternative that seeks the peak of the posterior probability by estimating the entire trajectory and landmark poses. It can be formulated as a nonlinear least squares problem and has a graph interpretation, related to Pose Graph Optimization.

Challenges in SLAM include robustness, scalability, representation, and theoretical guarantees.

**6. Robot Operating System (ROS)**

Robot Operating System (ROS) is an **open-source framework for robotics development**, supported by the Open Source Robotics Foundation. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions for creating complex robot applications. ROS began in 2007 and was initially funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), later supported by Willow Garage, and is now supported by the Open Source Robotics Foundation.

ROS is based on key concepts:

- **Nodes:** These are the "executables". They are executable processes that perform computation in ROS, such as reading sensor data, controlling actuators, or performing algorithms. Nodes can be multi-threaded.
- **Topics:** These are named buses used for nodes to exchange information in a publish/subscribe messaging pattern. Topics are used to pass information between nodes and support many-to-many communication.
- **ROS Master:** This is a special node in ROS that curates the communication between other nodes. However, traffic doesn't pass through the ROS Master directly.
- **Messages:** These define the structure of information passed on topics. They can include primitive types and higher-level built-in types like `geometry_msgs`, `nav_msgs`, and `sensors_msgs`. Messages are the data structures used for communication.
- **Parameters:** These are configuration values that can be loaded at launch time and stored on a server. They can be queried or adjusted by nodes during runtime.

Other concepts in ROS include Publishing/Subscribing (mechanisms for nodes to send and receive information on topics), Launch Files (XML files to define and run multiple nodes and configurations), Packages (units of ROS code), and Services (request/reply communication mechanisms).

The sources do not explicitly list and explain five "main libraries" of ROS. Instead, they describe core concepts and mention different types of built-in messages (`geometry_msgs`, `nav_msgs`, `sensors_msgs`) which might be associated with libraries providing functionality for these data types. Packages are described as units of ROS code. Examples of ROS packages mentioned include `gmapping` for PF-SLAM.

**7. Computer Vision/Image Processing Questions:**

- **How can we use machine/deep learning in computer vision?** Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are used as techniques for various tasks within the field of computer vision. The sources extensively discuss the application of ML and DL algorithms for Human Activity Recognition (HAR), which is treated as a classification problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. Prominent ML techniques used for HAR include Support Vector Machine (SVM). State-of-the-art deep learning techniques frequently used for HAR, especially with larger datasets, are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). These examples demonstrate how ML/DL algorithms are applied to process visual or sensor data to understand and classify actions, a core aspect of computer vision.
- **Explain object detection:** The provided sources mention techniques and applications that involve identifying or locating objects, such as recognizing objects, multi-target object recognition, using Mask R-CNN, SSD algorithm with bounded box, proposal-based solutions for action detection, and separating object entities. However, the sources **do not provide a general explanation or definition of "object detection"** as a standalone concept.
- **Explain human activity recognition (HAR):** Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the task of **identifying and classifying human activities from sensor data or visual information**. HAR is widely used in various domains and has potential applications in areas like healthcare, surveillance, sports and event analysis, elderly care, and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). It is treated as a typical classification problem in computer vision and pattern recognition.

HAR is studied as both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. The majority of existing literature treats HAR as a supervised classification problem. Various sensors are utilized for HAR, including **vision-based sensors** (such as CCTV, Kinect, Smart Phone Camera) and **sensor-based sensors** (like Mobile Sensors and Wearable Device Sensors). The majority of existing HAR solutions reviewed in one source used vision-based data (70%), although studies also rely on sensor-based data (34%).

Many ML algorithms are used for HAR. The most frequently used techniques include **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, **Long short-term memory (LSTM)**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. CNN and LSTM are state-of-the-art deep learning techniques that generally require larger datasets, while SVM is a traditional machine learning algorithm often preferred for smaller datasets.

Challenges and limitations in HAR include data collection and preprocessing, handling complex and misaligned activities, and hardware limitations. Factors like lighting, background, crowded scenes, camera viewpoint, and action complexity can affect the accuracy of HAR. Achieving higher accuracy requires investigating optimal window size, network intensity, and breadth, and there is a need for more diverse data mining methods and deep learning structural designs for better results.
