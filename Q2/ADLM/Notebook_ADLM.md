This briefing document summarizes the main themes and important ideas presented in the provided lecture excerpts on advanced deep learning models, specifically focusing on object detection, semantic segmentation, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and Transformers.

## 1. Object Detection

**Main Theme:** Object detection involves both classifying objects within an image and localizing them using bounding boxes. It differs from image classification, which only assigns a label to the entire image.

**Key Ideas and Facts:**

- **Definition:** Object detection locates objects in an image and classifies them. It involves both classification (identifying the object's class) and regression (predicting the bounding box).
- "Locating objects in an image and classifying them"
- "Object Detection takes into account the object in the image and its class (Classification) and its bounding box (Regression)"
- **Comparison with Image Classification:** Image classification identifies the content of an image as a whole, outputting a single label or a list of labels with probabilities, without locating the objects. Object detection, on the other hand, identifies and localizes multiple objects with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.
- **Image Classification Output:** "A single label or a list of labels with probabilities."
- **Object Detection Output:** "Bounding box coordinates along with class labels and confidence scores for multiple objects."
- **Applications:** Object detection has numerous applications, including crowd counting, autonomous cars, video surveillance, face detection, and anomaly detection.
- **Bounding Box Parameters:** Bounding boxes are typically defined by four parameters, which can be either the centroid (center coordinates, width, height) or corner coordinates (bottom-left and top-right). The task involves regressing these parameters.
- "Bounding boxes are typically given with 4 parameters, our task is to regress them"
- "Centroid: coordinates of the center of the box, width, and height"
- "Corner: coordinates of bottom-left and top-right corner"
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** Many object detection methods follow an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder (often a pre-trained CNN like ResNet or VGG) extracts features, and the decoder (detection head) predicts bounding boxes and class labels.
- "The encoder is typically a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) such as ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet."
- "The decoder predicts bounding boxes and class labels."
- **Metrics:** Key evaluation metrics for object detection include:
- **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Measures the overlap between predicted and ground-truth bounding boxes.
- "Evaluation metric used to measure the accuracy of an object detector on a particular dataset"
- "We compare ground-truth bounding boxes ... to the predicted bounding boxes"
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** Calculates the average precision (area under the precision-recall curve) for each class at various IoU thresholds and then takes the mean over all classes.
- "The mean average precision is the mean of the average precision scores over every class"
- **Evolution of Architectures:R-CNN (2014):** First proposes potential object regions using Selective Search (\~2000 proposals), then extracts features using a CNN for each region, and finally classifies and refines the bounding boxes. Limitations include slow inference speed due to processing each region individually and high storage requirements.
- "The model first proposes potential object regions using an algorithm called Selective Search."
- "Each region proposal is cropped and resized to a fixed size ... A CNN ... extracts features from each cropped region."
- "Slow inference speed: Each region proposal (\~2000 per image) is processed individually through a CNN, making it very slow."
- **Fast R-CNN (2015):** Processes the entire image through a CNN once to get a feature map. Region proposals (from Selective Search) are then projected onto this feature map using RoI pooling. This significantly improves speed.
- "The entire image is passed through a CNN ... once to extract a feature map."
- "region proposals ... are projected onto the feature map, i.e. fixed-size feature vectors are extracted for each region."
- **Faster R-CNN (2016):** Replaces Selective Search with a learned Region Proposal Network (RPN). The RPN slides a small CNN over the feature map and predicts objectness and bounding box adjustments for predefined anchor boxes. This makes the region proposal step also learnable and further improves speed, moving towards real-time detection.
- "Gets rid of Selective Search in favor of a learned region proposal method."
- "Instead of using Selective Search, an RPN predicts potential object regions."
- "At each location, k predefined anchor boxes ... are placed."
- **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS):** A post-processing technique used in R-CNN family models to prune overlapping and redundant bounding box predictions. It removes boxes with low confidence and, for those with high confidence that overlap significantly (based on an IoU threshold), keeps only the one with the highest confidence.
- "Remove the boxes that were predicted with low confidence..."
- "To select the best one among the top-performing candidates, NMS selects the box with the highest confidence level and calculates how it intersects in area with the other boxes around (using IoU)."
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once) (2016):** Treats object detection as a regression problem and processes the entire image in a single forward pass. It divides the image into a grid, and each cell predicts bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class probabilities for objects whose center falls within it. This leads to very fast, real-time object detection.
- "YOLO processes the image in a single pass through the network, i.e. bounding boxes and object classes are predicted simultaneously."
- "The input image is divided into an S × S grid ... Each cell is responsible for detecting objects whose center falls inside it..."
- **DETR (Detection Transformer) (2020):** Directly predicts objects and their locations using a Transformer-based architecture, without relying on region proposals, anchor boxes, or NMS. While accurate, it typically requires more data and longer training times and can be slower at inference than models like YOLO.
- "Predicts objects and their locations directly without additional components (e.g., region proposals, anchor boxes, or NMS)."
- "Replaces traditional convolutional-based detection heads with Transformer-based architectures."
- **Benchmarks:** Common datasets for evaluating object detection algorithms include MS COCO and ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). The Probabilistic Object Detection Challenge focuses on estimating both spatial and semantic uncertainty.

## 2. Semantic Segmentation

**Main Theme:** Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in an image into predefined categories.

**Key Ideas and Facts:**

- **Definition:** Semantic segmentation identifies and classifies groups of pixels according to their characteristics, assigning a label to every pixel in the image.
- "Semantic segmentation identifies collections of pixels and classifies them according to various characteristics."
- "Semantic segmentation assigns a label to every pixel in the image"
- **Related Tasks:Instance Segmentation:** Distinguishes between different instances of the same object class.
- "*Instance segmentation focuses on countable objects and identifies the pixels for each different instance*"
- **Panoptic Segmentation:** Combines semantic and instance segmentation, where each instance is segmented, and every pixel has a label.
- "Panoptic segmentation is a combination of the two, where each instance is separated, and every pixel has a label."
- **Architecture:** Traditional semantic segmentation architectures often use a two-stage approach: a CNN for feature extraction followed by pixel-wise classification (e.g., using SVMs or Random Forests). Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) replace fully connected layers with convolutional layers, allowing for variable input sizes and spatial output maps.
- "Traditional architectures for semantic segmentation are also two-stage: first, a CNN processes the image, then each pixel is classified based on the feature maps"
- "Fully Convolutional Networks replace the fully connected layers of conventional CNNs with convolutional layers, allowing the network to take input of any size and output a spatial map..."
- **Segmentation Masks:** The output of a segmentation model is a segmentation mask, which isolates specific portions of an image.
- "A segmentation mask is a specific portion of an image that is isolated from the rest of an image: it is the output of a segmentation model"
- **Encoder-Decoder for Segmentation:** Similar to object detection, segmentation models often use an encoder (CNN for feature extraction) and a decoder (up-sampler to create a full-size segmentation mask from the feature maps).
- "Encode: Use a CNN to extract features... Decode: Turn features into a segmentation mask. The decoder is an up-sampler..."
- **U-Net:** A specific CNN architecture initially developed for biomedical image segmentation. It enhances accuracy by using upsampling (deconvolution) instead of pooling operations in the decoder, and it incorporates skip connections to combine high-level and low-level features.
- "The U-Net is a convolutional neural network initially developed for biomedical image segmentation."
- "The U-Net architecture enhances the segmentation accuracy by incorporating upsampling operators instead of pooling operations."
- **Upsampling (Deconvolution):** Used in the U-Net decoder to increase the spatial dimensions of feature maps, typically involving interpolation followed by a convolutional layer (after concatenation with skip connections).
- "Upsampling in a U-net is done with “deconvolution”."
- "The deconvolution operation starts with upsampling the input feature map to increase its spatial dimensions... After upsampling, a convolutional layer is applied to the upsampled feature map concatenated with the skip connection."
- **Output Channels:** Segmentation models typically have one output channel per class. These channels, when aggregated, form the final segmentation mask, where each filter in the final layer detects what belongs to its specific class.
- "One output channel per class: aggregated, they form the mask."
- "The final layer is made up of as many filters as classes: each filter detects what belongs to its class."

## 3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Main Theme:** GANs are a class of unsupervised learning models designed for generative tasks, using an adversarial process between a generator and a discriminator network.

**Key Ideas and Facts:**

- **Definition:** GANs consist of two neural networks: a generator that tries to create realistic data samples and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real data and the data generated by the generator. These two networks are trained adversarially and simultaneously.
- "Generative Adversarial Network"
- "Generative: Generate new output (not from a predefined class or dictionary)"
- "Adversarial: Two networks, the generator and its adversary, the discriminator."
- "The generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating data while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data."
- **Applications:** GANs have various applications, including image generation (deepfakes), image-to-image translation (e.g., photo to painting), and data augmentation.
- "Image generation (e.g., deepfake creation)."
- "Image-to-image translation (e.g. converting a photograph of a real-world scene into a drawing or a painting)."
- "Data augmentation."
- **Basic Architecture:** The generator's architecture depends on the data type (e.g., fully connected for low-dimensional data like MNIST, CNN like U-Net for high-resolution images, LSTM for sequential data like music).
- "The generator in a GAN can be any neural network architecture that is suitable for the type of data being generated"
- **Unsupervised Learning (with a twist):** GANs are considered a form of unsupervised learning as they don't require labeled input data. However, during training, the discriminator labels data as real or fake, allowing for the definition of a loss function and accuracy measurement.
- "GANs are a type of unsupervised learning because we do not label input data"
- "However, data is labeled for the generator as fake or real, so it is easy to define a loss function and to measure accuracy"
- **Minimax Game:** The training process can be viewed as a two-player minimax game where the generator tries to minimize the discriminator's ability to distinguish fake data, and the discriminator tries to maximize its accuracy in this task. At equilibrium, the discriminator would output 1/2 everywhere, indicating it cannot differentiate between real and fake data. However, true equilibrium is hard to achieve in practice.
- "The generator G and the discriminator D are jointly trained in a two-player minimax game formulation"
- "We can prove that, at the equilibrium, D outputs 1/2 everywhere because D has no idea how to distinguish fake generated data from real data."
- **Loss Functions:Discriminator Loss:** Typically binary cross-entropy, as it acts as a classifier.
- "Loss for the discriminator: Binary cross entropy- it is a classifier"
- **Generator Loss:** Calculated based on the discriminator's classification of the generated data.
- "Loss for the generator: The generator loss is calculated from the discriminator’s classification"
- **Training Process:** Involves simultaneous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to update the weights of both the generator and the discriminator. Gradient-based optimization methods like Adam can be used. The generator learns indirectly through the feedback from the discriminator, resembling a form of reinforcement learning.
- "The training process consists of simultaneous SGD."
- "The two gradient steps are made simultaneously: one updating the generator and one updating the discriminator."
- "We can think of the generator network as learning by a strange kind of reinforcement learning."
- **Resistance to Overfitting:** GANs can be resistant to overfitting because the generator does not directly access or copy training examples; it only learns from the discriminator's assessment.
- "this makes GANs resistant to overfitting, because the generator has no opportunity in practice to directly copy training examples"
- **Mode Collapse:** A common problem in GAN training where the generator produces limited diversity in its output, often focusing on generating samples that particularly fool the discriminator.
- "the generator produces limited diversity in its output"
- "Tricking the discriminator by outputting patterns it finds most likely"
- **History and Evolution:Original GAN (2014):** Introduced by Ian Goodfellow et al., aiming to create plausible training data.
- "GANs were introduced in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow et al."
- "The original aim was to create plausible training data for image tasks"
- **Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) (2015):** By Radford et al., specifically designed for image generation using convolutional layers (and transpose convolutions for upsampling in the generator). Improved upon the original GAN for high-quality image generation.
- "Architecture specifically designed for image generation"
- "Utilizes convolutional layers vs connected layers for original GAN"
- "Uses transpose convolutions to upsample and generate spatial structure."
- **CycleGAN (2017):** By Zhu et al., for unpaired image-to-image translation using a cycle-consistency loss to ensure that translations are reversible.
- "Image-to-image translation without having a one-to-one mapping (unpaired image-to-image translation)"
- "Novel loss function based on the idea that the generator and discriminator should be the inverse of each other..."
- **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) (2017):** By Martin et al., replaces the discriminator with a "critic" that scores realness, providing a more stable training process and being less sensitive to architecture and hyperparameters.
- "The WGAN relaxes the role of the discriminator when training a GAN"
- "the WGAN changes or replaces the discriminator model with a critic that scores the realness or fakeness of a given image."
- "The benefit of the WGAN is that the training process is more stable..."
- **StyleGAN (2018):** By NVIDIA, decomposes the generator into a series of pyramidal generators, allowing for control over different levels of image features (style). It was behind the original deepfakes.
- "Decomposes the generator into a series of pyramidal generators"
- "During training, at first only a generator and a discriminator are trained to generate 4x4 images... until we reach a GAN game to generate 1024x1024 images."
- "This method is behind the original deepfakes"
- **Diffusion Models:** Current state-of-the-art image generation models like DALL-E and Stable Diffusion are based on diffusion, not GANs. They work by progressively adding noise to an image and then training a model to reverse this process (denoise). Generation is achieved by starting with random noise and denoising it. Unlike Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), they don't necessarily learn a latent space representation of the original images. Conditional denoising allows these models to generate images based on text prompts.
- "Current image generating models DALL-E and stable Diffusion are not based on GANs: they use diffusion"
- "Noise is progressively added to an original image ... A model is trained to de-noise and return the original image"
- "After training, image generation is achieved by passing random white noise to the denoiser"
- "In fact, these models use conditional denoising, to pair images with prompts"
- **Evaluating Generative Models:** Evaluation is challenging and involves various approaches:
- Task-based evaluation (in real-world applications).
- Turing-style tests (human evaluation).
- Truthfulness (assessing factual accuracy).
- Grammatical validity (for text generation).
- Comparison to a gold standard (e.g., using BLEU score).
- Using mark schemes (like human examiners).
- **Perplexity Score:** Used for evaluating language models, based on the probability of a sentence normalized by its length (lower is better).
- "Perplexity is a metric used to evaluate language models"
- "A high perplexity score means a low quality model"
- **Inception Score:** Used for evaluating image quality and diversity by assessing the predictions of a pre-trained Inception v3 model on generated images (higher is better, indicating sharp and diverse images).
- "Assess the quality of images"
- "The Inception Score is maximized when the following conditions are true: a. The classification model confidently predicts a single label for each image... b. The predictions of the classification model are evenly distributed across all possible labels."
- **TruthfulQA:** A benchmark to measure the truthfulness of language model outputs.
- "Benchmark to measure whether a language model is truthful in generating answers to questions."
- **Considerations:** Evaluation data should not be part of the training set. Consistency, variability, tone, grammar, and creativity are also factors to consider.
- **Hallucinations:** A major challenge where generative models produce outputs not based on training data or identifiable patterns, which are hard to detect.
- "outputs that are not based on training data, are incorrectly decoded or do not follow any identifiable pattern."

## 4. Transformers

**Main Theme:** Transformers are a neural network architecture that relies entirely on attention mechanisms to model dependencies between input and output sequences, without using recurrence (as in RNNs) or convolutions.

**Key Ideas and Facts:**

- **Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention (Reminder):** Traditional sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with attention in the decoder compute weights over encoder positions based on each decoder position, allowing the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.
- "In the decoder ... compute attention weights over encoder positions that depend on each decoder position"
- **Transformer Architecture:** Transformers differ from RNNs and CNNs by:
- Using no convolutions or recurrence, making them easier to parallelize and faster to train.
- "No convolutions or recurrence"
- "easier to parallelize than recurrent nets"
- "faster to train than recurrent nets"
- Capturing long-range dependencies more effectively than CNNs with fewer parameters.
- "captures more long-range dependencies than CNNs with fewer parameters"
- Being the foundation of models like BERT and GPT.
- "The architecture behind BERT and GPT"
- **Self-Attention:** The core of the Transformer. It allows each input element to attend to all other elements in the input set (order initially doesn't matter) to compute a weighted average, thus capturing their relevance to each other.
- "Each output is a weighted average of all inputs"
- "The idea: inputs “look at each other” and assess their relevance for each other"
- **Query, Key, and Value:** In self-attention, each input data point plays three roles:
- **Query:** Used to compare with all other keys to determine attention weights for its own output.
- "It is compared with all other data points to construct weights for its own output query: how close are we?"
- **Key:** Represents the input element being compared against the queries of other elements to determine the attention weight it should receive.
- "It is compared with every other data point xj to construct weights for their output key: this is how close I am to you"
- **Value:** The actual information content of the input element that is aggregated based on the attention weights.
- "Once all the weights wij have been constructed, it is used to finally synthesize each actual output value: this is the actual values I contain"
- **Self-Attention Layer:** Contains learnable parameters (weight matrices for query, key, and value) that modulate the input vectors for each role, making the attention mechanism learnable.
- "Deterministic self-attention is not sufficient to encode enough information, so the self-attention layer also contains learnable parameters"
- "There are learnable parameters that reweigh each vector for each role: for query, key, and value"
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** Improves the model's ability to capture different types of relationships by concatenating the outputs of several independent self-attention layers ("heads"). These heads can learn to play different "roles," such as capturing positional information or syntactic dependencies.
- "We concatenate several independent self-attention layers"
- "these heads play different 'roles' in the model: e.g., positional or tracking syntactic dependencies."
- **Transformer Block:** A fundamental building block of the Transformer architecture. It typically includes a multi-head self-attention layer, followed by layer normalization, a feedforward neural network (often with skip connections), and another layer normalization. Multiple such blocks are stacked to form the complete Transformer.
- "Notice it is complete feedforward"
- "it features skip connections"
- "Multiple transformer blocks are put together to form the transformer architecture."
- "the Transformer reads the entire sequence of words at once, rather than in a sequential way as in RNNs"
- **Transformers vs GANs vs Diffusion:Computational Efficiency:** Transformers are memory-intensive due to attention, while GANs are compute-intensive due to adversarial training. GANs can be more efficient for inference. Training GPT-3 was estimated to be very energy-intensive. GANs might be easier to parallelize but are less stable for large-scale applications.
- "While transformers are heavy on memory due to attention operations, GANs are heavy on compute due to the iterative adversarial training"
- "GANs can generate outputs efficiently and require less compute for inference than training making them lighter than transformers for deployment"
- "The electricity required to train GPT-3 was estimated at around 1,287,000 kWh"
- "GANs are unstable to train, so not adequate for large-scale applications"
- **Use-Case Considerations:** Transformers need large datasets, while GANs are more adaptable to limited data. Transformers excel with sequential data, which is harder for GANs. GANs are fast at inference, suitable for real-time generation. GANs are generative, not predictive. Transformers work well with multimodal data.
- "Transformers require significant amounts of data for training, GANs are very adaptable to cases where training data is limited"
- "GANs do not handle sequential data easily, transformers perform very well with sequential dependencies"
- "GANs are quick at inference time, making them useful for real-time generation"
- "Generation vs prediction: GANs are generative, not predictive"
- "Transformers are good with multimodal data (e.g. text to image)"
- **Output Quality:** GANs can produce more photorealistic images, while Transformers might offer more variation. Both can reproduce biases from the training data.
- "GANs are better at photorealism"
- "Transformers can offer more variation"
- "GANs learn from dataset examples, meaning biases come from underrepresentation or imbalanced training data"
- "Transformers reproduce the biases found in the dataset in terms of stereotypes or offensiveness"
- **Multimodal Models:** Models that can process or produce different types of data (text, image, audio, etc.). Two common fusion approaches are:
- **Late Fusion:** Processes each modality independently and then merges the representations at a later stage.
- "Each modality ... is processed independently using separate encoders... The processed representations are then merged at the final stage..."
- **Early Fusion:** Feeds raw multimodal inputs into the same Transformer model using a shared embedding space, allowing for deeper cross-modal interactions but can be harder to train.
- "Raw multimodal inputs are fed into the same transformer model using a shared embedding space."
- "This allows deeper cross-modal interactions throughout the entire network."
- "Hard to train"

## Quiz Answer Key

1. Image classification identifies the overall content of an image and assigns a single label (or a list of labels with probabilities). For an image with a cat, the output would be "cat" with a certain probability. Object detection, on the other hand, locates objects within the image and classifies them, providing bounding boxes around each detected object. The output for the same image would be a bounding box enclosing the cat with the label "cat" and a confidence score.
2. Bounding boxes are typically represented by four parameters that define their location and size. Two common ways to define these parameters are: 1) **Centroid, width, and height:** specifying the coordinates of the center of the box and its width and height. 2) **Corner coordinates:** specifying the coordinates of two opposite corners of the box, such as the bottom-left and top-right corners.
3. Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric that quantifies the overlap between a predicted bounding box and a ground-truth bounding box. It is calculated as the area of their intersection divided by the area of their union. IoU is important because it provides a measure of how accurate the localization of an object is in an object detection model. A higher IoU indicates a better overlap and thus a more accurate prediction.
4. The three main stages of R-CNN are: 1) **Region Proposal:** using Selective Search to generate around 2000 potential object regions. 2) **Feature Extraction:** using a CNN to extract features from each proposed region after cropping and resizing. 3) **Classification and Bounding Box Refinement:** using an SVM to classify the extracted features and a regressor to refine the bounding box coordinates. A significant limitation of R-CNN was its slow inference speed due to processing each region proposal individually through the CNN.
5. Faster R-CNN improves upon Fast R-CNN by introducing a **Region Proposal Network (RPN)**. Instead of relying on the pre-determined Selective Search algorithm for generating region proposals, the RPN is a learned network that predicts potential object regions directly from the convolutional feature map of the input image. This allows for a more efficient and end-to-end trainable object detection system.
6. The core idea behind YOLO is to treat object detection as a regression problem, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the entire image in a single forward pass through the network. Unlike two-stage methods that first propose regions and then classify them, YOLO divides the image into a grid and each grid cell is responsible for detecting objects whose center falls within it, leading to very fast inference speeds suitable for real-time applications.
7. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of generative model composed of two neural networks: a **generator** and a **discriminator**. The generator's role is to create synthetic data samples that resemble the real training data, while the discriminator's role is to distinguish between real and fake (generated) data. These two networks are trained simultaneously in an adversarial manner, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to correctly identify the real and fake samples.
8. The U-Net is a convolutional neural network architecture primarily developed for **biomedical image segmentation**. Its architecture features an encoder path that downsamples the input image to capture context and a decoder path that upsamples the encoded features to produce a segmentation mask of the same size as the input. Upsampling in the decoder, often done with "deconvolution," increases the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, allowing for precise localization and the creation of a full-size segmentation mask. It is typically followed by a convolution to refine the features.
9. Self-attention is a mechanism in Transformer networks that allows each element in an input sequence (or set) to attend to and interact with all other elements, directly computing a weighted average where the weights represent the relevance of each element to the others. In self-attention, each input data point plays three roles: **query** (used to compare with all other keys), **key** (compared against other queries to determine relevance), and **value** (the actual information that is aggregated based on the attention weights).
10. The key architectural difference between Transformer networks and RNNs/CNNs is the absence of recurrence and convolutions in their core self-attention mechanisms. Transformers primarily rely on self-attention to capture dependencies between different positions in the input sequence, allowing for **parallel processing** of the entire input, which leads to faster training times compared to sequential processing in RNNs. Additionally, self-attention can capture **long-range dependencies** more effectively than CNNs with a limited receptive field, and often with fewer parameters.

- **Transformer:** A neural network architecture that relies entirely on self-attention mechanisms to compute representations of its input, without using recurrence or convolutions.
- **Self-Attention:** A mechanism within Transformer networks that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence when processing each position. It involves calculating query, key, and value representations and computing attention weights based on their relationships.
- **Query, Key, Value:** Components used in the self-attention mechanism. The query of one element is compared to the keys of all other elements to determine attention weights, which are then used to compute a weighted sum of the corresponding values.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** An extension of self-attention that uses multiple independent attention mechanisms (heads) in parallel, allowing the model to capture different types of relationships in the data.
- **Skip Connections:** Direct connections that bypass one or more layers in a neural network, allowing gradients to flow more easily and helping to preserve fine-grained details, as seen in U-Net and Transformer architectures.
- **Diffusion Models:** Generative models that learn to reverse a process of gradually adding noise to data, allowing them to generate new samples by starting from random noise and iteratively denoising it.
