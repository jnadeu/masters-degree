## Briefing Document: Natural Language Processing Fundamentals and Modern Techniques

This briefing document summarizes the key themes and important ideas from the provided sources, covering foundational NLP techniques, modern deep learning approaches, Large Language Models (LLMs), and sentiment analysis using the NLTK library.

**I. Foundational NLP Concepts (Merit NLP - Day 1.pdf & NLP Merit - Day 1 - NLP basics.pdf)**

These sources introduce fundamental concepts and techniques in NLP, focusing on data exploration, cleaning, text preprocessing, and basic text representations.

**A. Data Exploration and Cleaning (Terminal Usage):**

The documents highlight the utility of command-line tools for basic text manipulation:

- **sort**: Sorts lines alphabetically or numerically.
- Usage: sort file.txt
- **tr**: Translates characters.
- Usage: tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' < file.txt (changes lowercase to uppercase)
- **sed**: Stream editor for search/replace, deletion, and more.
- Usage: sed 's/old/new/g' file.txt
- **uniq**: Removes duplicate lines (requires sorting first for non-consecutive duplicates).
- Usage: sort file.txt | uniq
- **rev**: Reverses characters on each line.
- Usage: rev file.txt
- **grep**: Finds text lines matching a pattern.
- Usage: grep 'pattern' file.txt (-i for case-insensitive, -v to invert matches)
- **awk**: Flexible text processing, pattern scanning, column extraction.
- Usage: awk '{print $2}' file.txt (prints the second column)

**B. Tokenization:**

Tokenization is defined as "**breaking text into smaller units, i.e. tokens**". A **token** is an "**instance of a sequence of characters...grouped as a useful semantic unit**". Key concepts include:

- **Type**: The class of all tokens with the same character sequence.
- **Vocabulary**: The collection of all types.
- Example: "A rose is a rose is a rose" -> 8 word tokens, 3 types.

Challenges in tokenization are highlighted:

- Multi-word entities (e.g., "San Francisco", "L'ensemble").
- Compound nouns in languages like German ("*Kraftfahrzeughaftpflichtversicherung*").
- Lack of explicit word boundaries in languages like Chinese and Japanese ("自然语言处理课程").

Different tokenization strategies are discussed:

- **Character-based Tokenization**: Splits text into individual characters.
- Advantages: Few unknown words (OOV), useful for morphology-rich languages, smaller number of types, easy to implement.
- Disadvantages: Characters may not have meaning, larger sequences for models.
- **Word-based Tokenization**: Splits text by spaces and punctuation.
- Advantages: Easy to implement.
- Disadvantages: Doesn't work well for languages without spaces, huge vocabulary size, misspelt words treated as unique tokens.
- **Subword Tokenization**: Splits words into subwords.
- Advantage: Limits vocabulary size by representing frequent words directly and splitting rare words into frequent subwords (e.g., "unwanted" -> "un", "want", "ed").

**C. Stemming:**

Stemming aims to "**group words that are derived from a common stem**" (e.g., "fish", "fishes", "fishing" -> "fish").

- Generally provides small improvements in task effectiveness.
- Output is not always a valid word ("Centuries" -> "Centurie").
- Different levels of aggressiveness exist.
- **Porter Stemmer**: Common rule-based stemmer for English (e.g., "connecting" -> "connect").
- **Snowball Stemmer (Porter2)**: Improved, multilingual, and faster version of Porter.

**D. Lemmatization:**

Lemmatization groups "**together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word's lemma, or dictionary form**" (e.g., "corpora" -> "corpus", "better" -> "good").

- Unlike stemming, it considers the part of speech and meaning.
- **Dictionary-Based Lemmatization**: Uses lookup tables.
- Often involves Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging before dictionary lookup (e.g., WordNet Lemmatizer).

**E. Text Representations:**

The sources cover basic methods for converting text into numerical vectors:

- **One-Hot Encoding**: Represents each word in the vocabulary as a vector where the position corresponding to the word is marked with 1, and all other positions are 0.
- Disadvantage: Removes all word ordering; "today is off" and "Is today off" have the same vector.
- **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Represents each document as a vector where each position corresponds to a word in the vocabulary, and the value is the frequency of that word in the document.
- Disadvantage: Also removes word ordering.
- **Bag of N-grams**: Extends BoW by considering sequences of n words (n-grams).
- Captures some contextual information, e.g., for negation ("not good").
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Weights words based on their frequency in a document and their inverse frequency across the entire corpus.
- Assigns higher weights to words frequent in a document but rare overall.
- **Word2vec**: Represents words as high-dimensional vectors capturing semantic relationships between words.
- Based on the idea that "**You shall know a word by the company it keeps**" (J. R. Firth).
- Trained using shallow neural networks to predict neighboring words (Skipgram) or a word given its neighbors (CBOW).

**II. Modern Techniques in NLP (NLP Merit - Day 2 - Modern techniques on NLP.pdf & Session 2 NLP.pdf)**

These sources delve into more advanced deep learning architectures used in NLP.

**A. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, and GRUs:**

- **RNNs**: Process sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures information about previous inputs. Weights are shared across time steps.
- **LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks)**: Address the vanishing gradient problem in RNNs by introducing a memory cell and gates (input, forget, output) to control the flow of information.
- **Cell state**: Long-term memory.
- **Hidden state**: Working memory (present in both RNNs and LSTMs).
- **GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units)**: Simplified version of LSTMs with fewer gates (update and reset), often faster to train.
- **Problems with RNNs/LSTMs/GRUs**:
- Slow to train (sequential processing).
- Limited contextual awareness (uni-directional LSTMs). Bi-directional LSTMs improve this but still concatenate contexts.
- Challenges with very long sequences.

**B. Self-Attention and Transformers (2017):**

- The "**Attention is all you need**" paper introduced the Transformer architecture based entirely on self-attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence.
- **Self-Attention**: Allows each word in a sequence to attend to all other words, assigning different weights to their importance in understanding the current word's context. "**In attention each old word can have different weight.**"
- **Advantages over LSTMs**:
- Faster training due to parallelization. "**Same BLEU metric 100 or 1000 times faster because is parallelized.**"
- Better at capturing long-range dependencies.
- No hidden state in the core Transformer architecture; context is captured via attention and positional encoding.
- **Transformer Architecture**: Non-recurrent encoder-decoder structure with stacks of layers and sublayers.

**C. Tokenizers (Modern Context):**

- Modern tokenizers break words into subwords using algorithms like Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, and Unigram.
- Example: "filming" -> "film", "##ing".
- Use **special tokens**: [CLS] (beginning of sentence), [SEP] (separator), [MASK] (removed word), [UNK] (unknown).
- Tokenizers are crucial and can impact model behavior.

**D. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):**

- A pre-trained deep bidirectional Transformer for language understanding tasks.
- **Pre-training tasks**:
- **Masked attention**: Predicting masked words based on context.
- **Next sentence prediction**: Determining if one sentence follows another.

**E. Fine-Tuning:**

- Training models from scratch is difficult. Fine-tuning involves adapting pre-trained models for specific tasks.
- Common strategies:
- Freezing most layers and training only the last classification layer.
- Continuous pre-training on domain-specific data followed by fine-tuning.
- Fine-tuning by adjusting all model weights using techniques like SGD.

**F. State Space Models (SSMs) (2022):**

- Represent systems through their possible states and transitions.
- Can be seen as recurrent networks when discretized.
- Offer potentially more efficient processing for long sequences compared to Transformers (O(n) vs. O(n^2) complexity in some aspects).

**III. Large Language Models (LLMs) (NLP Merit - Day 4 - LLMs I.pdf & NLP Merit - Day 5 - LLMs II.pdf):**

These sources discuss the training, fine-tuning, and prompting of Large Language Models.

**A. Training Steps:**

- **Fine-tuning**: Adapting the pre-trained model for specific tasks using labeled data.
- **Instruction Fine-tuning (RLHF - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**: Further refining the model's behavior to better follow human instructions and preferences.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging knowledge gained from pre-training on downstream tasks.

**B. Prompt Engineering:**

- Crafting effective prompts is crucial for eliciting desired responses from LLMs.
- Techniques:
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Guiding the model to reason step-by-step.
- **Meta Prompting**: Using prompts to control the behavior and characteristics of the LLM (e.g., defining its role and instructions).

**C. Prompting in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**

- Prompting plays a very relevant role in RAG systems, which combine information retrieval with LLMs.
- Key issues:
- Managing hallucinations (generating incorrect information).
- Customizations (personality, tone, format).
- Constraints (rules, restrictions).
- Tasks for prompting in RAG:
- Improving retrieval relevance.
- Rephrasing in chats.
- Answering questions based on retrieved context.
- Enabling extraction agents and dialogue agents.

**D. Agents and Tool Use:**

- An **Agent** is "**a system that uses an AI Model to: Understand natural language, Reason and plan, Interact with its environment.**"
- Agents can use tools to gather information and take actions.

10. What is the main goal of using pre-trained sentiment analyzers like VADER in NLTK, and for what type of text is VADER particularly well-suited?

## NLP Quiz Answer Key

1. The sort command arranges lines in a file alphabetically or numerically, while uniq removes adjacent duplicate lines. Using them together (sort file.txt | uniq) effectively removes all duplicate lines from a file. The order matters because uniq only removes consecutive duplicates, so the file must be sorted first for all duplicates to be identified and removed.
2. A 'token' is a specific instance of a sequence of characters in a document (e.g., the word "rose" appearing multiple times). A 'type' is the unique form of a token, representing the class of all tokens with the same character sequence (e.g., the type "rose"). In the sentence "A rose is a rose," there are 4 word tokens but only 3 types ("a," "rose," "is").
3. One challenge is languages like Chinese and Japanese that do not use spaces to delimit words, making it difficult to determine word boundaries. Another challenge is the potential for a huge vocabulary size, especially in morphologically rich languages, where many word variations exist.
4. Stemming is a rule-based process that aims to reduce words to their root form by stripping suffixes, often resulting in non-words. Lemmatization aims to reduce words to their dictionary form (lemma) by considering the word's meaning and part of speech, typically resulting in valid words. For example, stemming "better" might yield "better," while lemmatization would likely produce "good."
5. The Bag of Words model represents text as a vector where each dimension corresponds to a unique word in the vocabulary, and the value in each dimension is the frequency of that word in the document. A key limitation is that it completely ignores the order and structure of words in the text, losing important contextual information and semantic relationships.
6. "You shall know a word by the company it keeps" signifies that the meaning of a word can be inferred from the words that frequently appear around it (its context). Word2vec utilizes this principle by training a neural network to predict a target word from its neighbors (CBOW) or predict neighbors from a target word (Skipgram), and the learned weights capture semantic relationships between words.
7. LSTMs introduce a memory cell and gating mechanisms (input, forget, output gates) to control the flow of information and address the vanishing gradient problem. The forget gate specifically controls what information from the previous cell state should be discarded, allowing the network to retain relevant long-term dependencies.
8. LSTMs process sequential data step-by-step, relying on the hidden state to carry information through the sequence. Self-attention in Transformers allows each word in the input sequence to directly attend to all other words, calculating a weighted sum of their representations to determine the importance of each word in relation to the others, thus capturing both short-range and long-range dependencies in parallel.
9. Masked Language Modeling (MLM) involves randomly masking some words in a sentence and training the model to predict the original masked words based on the context of the unmasked words, forcing the model to understand bidirectional context. Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) involves training the model to predict whether a given sentence is the subsequent sentence to a previous one, helping it understand inter-sentence relationships.
10. The main goal of using pre-trained sentiment analyzers like VADER is to quickly and easily obtain sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound) for a given text without the need for training a custom model. VADER is particularly well-suited for analyzing the sentiment expressed in social media text due to its sensitivity to slang, emoticons, and sentiment-related words and phrases common in online communication.

5. Trace the development of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to Transformer networks, focusing on the challenges encountered with RNNs (e.g., vanishing gradients, sequential processing) and how mechanisms like LSTMs, GRUs, and self-attention were introduced to overcome these limitations, ultimately leading to the success of Transformer-based models in NLP.

## Glossary of Key Terms

- **Token:** An instance of a sequence of characters in a document, treated as a meaningful unit for NLP.
- **Type:** The unique form of a token, representing the class of all tokens with the same character sequence.
- **Vocabulary:** The complete collection of all unique types (words or subwords) in a corpus.
- **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down text into smaller units (tokens).
- **Stemming:** A process of reducing words to their root form by removing suffixes, often resulting in non-words.
- **Lemmatization:** The process of reducing words to their dictionary form (lemma), considering their meaning and part of speech.
- **Corpus:** A large collection of text samples used for linguistic analysis.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** A text representation technique where each word is represented by a binary vector, with a '1' indicating the presence of the word and '0' otherwise.
- **Bag of Words (BoW):** A text representation where a document is represented by the frequencies of the words within it, ignoring word order.
- **n-gram:** A contiguous sequence of n items (e.g., words) from a given text.
- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):** A weighting scheme that measures the importance of a word in a document relative to its frequency across the entire corpus.
- **Word Embedding:** A dense vector representation of a word that captures its semantic meaning and relationships with other words (e.g., Word2vec).
- **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network):** A type of neural network designed for processing sequential data, where the output of a previous step is fed as input to the current step.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Network):** A type of RNN with a memory cell and gating mechanisms to better handle long-range dependencies and the vanishing gradient problem.
