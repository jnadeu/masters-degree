## Answer Key

1. IoT connects devices across various sectors like smart homes or healthcare, focusing on user convenience and lifestyle. In contrast, IIoT connects machines in industrial sectors such as manufacturing or oil and gas, prioritizing efficiency, safety, and health in mission-critical environments.
2. Two significant benefits of IIoT are improved operational efficiency, through continuous monitoring and data analysis, and substantial cost savings, achieved by optimizing resource utilization and enabling predictive maintenance to prevent costly breakdowns.
3. The primary function of an IIoT gateway is to act as a translator and bridge between different devices and networks, often connecting legacy equipment or edge devices to IT networks or cloud servers. It aggregates, processes, and transmits data, enabling communication between systems that may use different protocols.
4. Industry 3.0 focused on digitalization with computers and automation software, leading to initial steps toward interconnectivity. Industry 4.0, however, integrates cyber-physical systems, IoT, real-time data access, and AI to achieve deeper interconnectivity between physical and digital systems, fostering enhanced decision-making and collaboration.
5. Two significant limitations of classical industrial communication protocols are lower security, as they often lack modern encryption and authentication mechanisms, and slower data transmission speeds, which may not meet the real-time requirements of many modern industrial applications. They also typically carry less data.
6. Edge computing contributes to IIoT efficiency by processing data closer to its source, which significantly minimizes latency and reduces bandwidth usage. This local processing enables real-time decision-making and immediate responses, crucial for applications like autonomous machinery or industrial automation.
7. AI plays a main role in predictive maintenance by analyzing real-time sensor data from machines to detect subtle patterns indicative of wear or potential failure. This allows for early identification of issues, enabling scheduled interventions, reducing unplanned downtime, and extending equipment lifespan.
8. IT/OT convergence is crucial because it integrates the data management capabilities of IT with the physical control systems of OT, enabling real-time data exchange across the entire enterprise. This integration enhances operational efficiency, improves decision-making through comprehensive data insights, and supports advanced automation initiatives for Industry 4.0.
9. One core technical challenge for blockchain adoption in IIoT is scalability. Blockchain systems may struggle to handle the high-frequency, massive volumes of data generated by thousands of IIoT devices in real-time without experiencing significant latency or requiring excessive computational resources.
10. Cobots are collaborative robots designed to work safely alongside humans, often with inherent size and speed limitations, unlike traditional industrial robots that are typically caged off for safety and perform tasks autonomously. Their purpose is to augment human workers, increasing efficiency and safety in shared workspaces.
